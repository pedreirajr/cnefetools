# cnefetools

**cnefetools** provides helper functions to work with the 2022 Brazilian National Address File for Statistical Purposes (*Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins Estatísticos*, CNEFE), an address-level dataset released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (*Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística*, IBGE).  
The initial version focuses on efficiently downloading, caching, and reading municipality-level CNEFE CSV files into Arrow tables for downstream analysis.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pedreirajr/cnefetools")
```

## Basic usage

``` r
library(cnefetools)

# Example - read CNEFE data for a municipality (Salvador)
tab_ssa <- read_cnefe(2927408, cache = TRUE)

# Convert to a tibble for inspection
df_ssa <- tab_ssa %>% 
  as.data.frame()

head(df_ssa)
```

## Caching behavior

By default, `cache = TRUE` stores the downloaded ZIP file in a user-level cache directory specific to this package. The exact location is handled internally via `tools::R_user_dir("cnefetools", "cache")`.

If you prefer to avoid persistent caching, set:

``` r
tab_ssa <- read_cnefe(2927408, cache = FALSE)
```

In this case, the ZIP file is stored in a temporary location and removed after reading.

## Roadmap

Planned extensions include:

-   Functions to compute land use mix indicators based on CNEFE records.
-   Functions to support dasymetric population interpolation using CNEFE as ancillary data.
-   Additional helpers for working with Arrow tables and spatial representations.
