The 2022 Brazilian CNEFE (*Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins
Estatísticos*) is an address-level dataset released by IBGE containing
over 100 million geocoded records across all Brazilian municipalities.
Each record carries the address type (`COD_ESPECIE`), geographic
coordinates, and a free-text description of the establishment
(`DSC_ESTABELECIMENTO`) for non-residential addresses.

`read_cnefe()` downloads and reads CNEFE data for any municipality,
returning either an Arrow table (default) or an `sf` spatial object of
point data. This article walks through a practical example: filtering
health facilities and finding those that contain the term "hospital" in
the `DSC_ESTABELECIMENTO` column.

## Downloading CNEFE data

You can download CNEFE data for any Brazilian municipality with just a
single line of code. By setting `output = "sf"`, the result is returned
as a spatial `sf` object, ready for mapping and spatial analysis. To
avoid downloading the same file in all sections, you can cache the
municipality of interest by setting the `cache` parameter to `TRUE`.

```{r}
library(cnefetools)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)

# Download CNEFE for Salvador (IBGE code 2927408) as an sf object
ssa_cnefe <- read_cnefe(code_muni = 2927408, cache = TRUE, output = "sf")
```

Be careful, however, when plotting the full dataset, since large
municipalities may contain millions of points (Salvador has over 1.3
million records).

## Exploring available columns

```{r}
names(ssa_cnefe)
```

Key columns for this example:

-   **`COD_ESPECIE`** — address type (1 = private household, 2 =
    collective household, 3 = agricultural, 4 = educational, 5 = health,
    6 = other, 7 = under construction, 8 = religious).
-   **`DSC_ESTABELECIMENTO`** — free-text name/description of the
    establishment (only filled for non-residential addresses).
-   **`geometry`** — point geometry with geographic coordinates.

A spreadsheet with the data dictionary (in Portuguese) can be accessed
with the function `cnefe_dictionary()`, which will open your system's
default spreadsheet viewer. To understand the whole methodology of the
CNEFE collection, you should also consult the PDF methodological
document (also in Portuguese) with the `cnefe_doc()` function.
Currently, only the CNEFE from the 2022 Census is available in the
package.

```{r}
## Opens the bundled Excel data dictionary:
cnefe_dictionary(year = 2022)

## Opens the bundled PDF methodological document:
cnefe_doc(year = 2022)
```

## Filtering for health establishments

We can keep only health establishments (`COD_ESPECIE == 5`):

```{r}
ssa_health <- ssa_cnefe |>
  filter(COD_ESPECIE == 5)

nrow(ssa_health)
```

## Searching for "hospital" in the description

We can use `grepl()` within `dplyr::filter()` to find records containing
specific terms:

```{r}
ssa_hospitals <- ssa_health |>
  filter(grepl("hospital", DSC_ESTABELECIMENTO, ignore.case = TRUE))

ssa_hospitals
```

## Mapping the results

Since we already have an `sf` object, we can visualise the locations
directly with `mapview`:

```{r}
library(mapview)

mapview(ssa_hospitals, layer.name = "Health facilities with 'hospital' term in their description column in Salvador")
```

## Working with Arrow tables for better performance

By default, `read_cnefe()` returns an Arrow table instead of an `sf`
object. Arrow tables are more memory-efficient and faster for large
municipalities, which makes them a better choice when you need to filter
or transform the data before converting to a spatial format:

```{r}
ssa_arrow <- read_cnefe(code_muni = 2927408, cache = TRUE)

class(ssa_arrow)
```

With Arrow, you can filter the data before loading it into memory with
`collect()`, and then convert only the subset you need to `sf`:

```{r}
ssa_hospitals_arrow <- ssa_arrow |>
  filter(COD_ESPECIE == 5) |>
  filter(grepl("hospital", DSC_ESTABELECIMENTO, ignore.case = TRUE)) |>
  collect() |>
  filter(!is.na(LONGITUDE), !is.na(LATITUDE)) |>
  st_as_sf(
    coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"),
    crs = 4674
  )
```

This approach is particularly useful when working with very large
municipalities where loading all records as `sf` at once may be slow.
